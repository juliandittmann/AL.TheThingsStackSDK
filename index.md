### What is The Things Stack?

The Things Stack is an enterprise grade LoRaWAN network server, built on an open source core. The Things Stack allows you to build and manage LoRaWAN networks on your own hardware or in the cloud. Reference: [here](https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/getting-started/what-is-tts/)

### Features

- Uses HTTPS by default.
- Accessible and extensible by other developers.
- Implements the documented best practices for The Things Stack. For example, it automatically encodes query parameters. A commonly overlooked stepped which greatly reduces the chances of invalid queries being sent to the service.
