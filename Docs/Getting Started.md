# Getting Started

## Start Using The Things Stack
To get started with The Things Stack, you can simply [create an account](https://console.cloud.thethings.network/) on The Things Network to start using [The Things Stack Community Edition](https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/getting-started/ttn/) for free.

To purchase a professional plan for The Things Stack, see [Pricing](https://accounts.thethingsindustries.com/fee-calculator).

If you are more of the DIY type, you can also [install and run your own network server](https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/getting-started/installation/), using the [open source stack](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/lorawan-stack).

## Start Building LoRaWan Solutions

Once you have access to The Things Stack, it’s time to start connecting devices. See the [Adding Devices section](https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/devices/adding-devices/) for instructions, or watch the video below for a complete introduction.

If you’re using The Things Stack Community in an urban area, you may already have gateway coverage thanks to other members of the public The Things Network community. See [The Things Network Coverage Map](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/map) to find out.

If you’re not covered, or you want to add gateways to extend the coverage of your network, see the [Adding Gateways section](https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/gateways/adding-gateways/).

Once you’ve added a device and it’s connected to a gateway and to The Things Stack, see the [Integrations section](https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/integrations/) to learn how to connect other services to act on device data.
